Known Issues:

We have disabled the loading music due to crashes, If you experience crashes please open an issue!

There is an issue that is with the options.txt file. There are issues
with the mods I usually use so until we get that fix I will ship a options 
file. Before updating to new versions if you make changes to your options file 
 make a backup copy first and replace it after updating.

Storage, Power and Other Worldly Dimensions Update

This update to SquirrelPAK TEC (TelEcommuniCations) we have the Storage, Power and Other Small Dimensions Update! We updated mods that had updates, added   Refine Storage (Newtwork_Squirrels favorite), and to power it Solar Flux Reborn!  Also threw in Entangled, and Compact Machines.

Fixed:
The default server config folder was missing... We opened an internal investigation to see which squirrel stashed them away.

Known Issues:
Had to disable the menu music. Not sure what is going on but we had crashes and it seemed to be from the FancyMenu. So the music is disabled until we can talk with the mod owner. If you experience crashes please open an issue!

There is an issue that is with the options.txt file. There are issues
with the mods I usually use so until we get that fix I will ship a options 
file. Before updating to new versions if you make changes to your options file 
 make a backup copy first and replace it after updating.
